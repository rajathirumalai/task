<h3>History</h3>

It spread globally with the expansion of the <mark>British Empire</mark>, with the first international matches in the second half of the <u>19th century</u>. The game's governing body is the <b>International Cricket Council</b> <i>ICC</i>,

<p2>In the approximate centre of the field is a <b>rectangular pitch</b> (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed <i>22 yards (20 m) apart</i>.[66] The pitch is a flat surface <u>10 feet (3.0 m) wide</u>, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of <strong>three wooden stumps topped by two bails</strong>.

<h5 style="font-size:15px">Stumps And bailes</h6>
<p3>A wicket consists of three stumps, or stakes, each <em>28 inches (71.1 cm) high</em> and of <u>equal thickness (about 1.25 inches in diameter)</u>, stuck into the ground and so spaced that the ball cannot pass between them. <i>Two pieces of wood called bails</i>, each 4.37 inches <small>11.1 cm</small> long, lie in grooves on the tops of the stumps. The bails do not extend beyond the stumps and do not project more than half an inch above them. The whole <mark>wicket is 9 inches (22.86 cm) in width</mark>. There are two of these wickets, which a batsman defends and a bowler attacks, and they are approximately in the centre of the ground, facing one another at each end of the pitch.
